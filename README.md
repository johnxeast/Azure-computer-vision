# Azure-computer-vision
This is a little scirpt that uses Azures computer vision software to analyze the images you take on your camera. Still working out the kinks. It's kinda useable if you have your Computer vision subscription key and Computer vision endpoint as well as your connection string and container name (blob storage).
